Hello Ivan,

The lab I will be using for this course is a virtual lab built in GNS3. My host running Ansible/Python/Git is a Centos7 VM also running in GNS3.

I will be running the following network devices in the lab:
- Cisco IOS (VIRL images)
- Cisco NX-OS (VIRL images)
- Palo Alto VM-100
- Cisco ISE (if I have the resources to run it)

Specific topologies and problems that I'm planning on developing automation solutions for include:
- Generic configuration templates for routers and switches
- Wired 802.1x troubleshooting and deployment
- DMVPN deployment and modification (changing encryption keys, Phase 1+2 crypto-maps, etc.)
- Cisco IOS zone-based firewall configuration deployments and data-gathering
- Management of Palo Alto configurations and data-gathering via their XML API
